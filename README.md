This is a tale as old as time. Evil spirits have always tried and many times succeeded in haunting our software, riddling it with bugs and creating paranormal behaviour, decreasing performance and shattering our nerves. But fret not! Our ancestors have collected powerful spells and potion recipes in a grimoire that they now have entrusted to our care. Today we want to share with you the secrets this book holds and help you get rid of those gremlins once and for all by utilising the power of testing.
